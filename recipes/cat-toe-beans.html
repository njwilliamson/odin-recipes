    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe was passed down to me from my uncle's uncle who himself stole it from 
        the cookbook of his third wife's aunt, who before whe died had cursed the recipe to be 
        so delicious that only the sturdiest of ovens could reach the hell and brimstone level temperatures
         that are required to bake the cheese properly. this was before the advent of electric fan ovens 
         so resta ssured that you are safe and well to continue.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
        <li>Cat (essential. Preferably stray)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>hate for cats</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>
        I will assume that you have caught, suffocated and prepped the cat, removing all four legs. If not, go back and complete these strps first.
     </li>
        <li>
        finely chop the garlic and lightly fry on a low heat with a fat lump of butter until thick slow bublling occurs. Imagine Lava.
     </li>   
        <li>
            seperate toe beans from foot and rub in palm for 30 secons each. This will bring out the umami thoughout the bean.
     </li>
        <li>
        add to pan and flash fry for 30 seconds. you are mearly searing the beans to keep the good oils inside from coming out.
     </li>   
        <li>
        serve in a ramikin and drizzle with lemon.
     </li>   
</ol>
