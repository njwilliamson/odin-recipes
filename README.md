This is a basic recipe website. 
I have utilised my skills in the terminal to create a local repository.
I then used the basic skills covered in the HTMl foundations course on Odin to code my website.
I used the terminal to upload all my changes through git to my github repository.
i then made the branch public so the website culd be accessed via the domain njwilliamson.github.io/odin-recipes
